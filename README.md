This project is about giving advice about amenity for Airbnb's new hosts in NYC by collecting, combining and analyzing the influence of amenities.


What I did:
• Collected and preprocessed over 40000 pieces of data of NYC Airbnb; used Python build multiple machine learning
models – NN, Random Forest and so on to evaluate the impact of various features on rent prices; simulated with data to
analyze the differences between the absence and presence of amenities and provided advice based on the analysis;
• Brought more than 41000 net profit premium with 600 cost for new host, which has increased by 195%.
